# Atmosphere-Vs-Sxos
A custom SXOS boot loader with Atmosphere all in one no messing around best of both worlds 


Atmosphere Vs SXos 

they are 4 different boot.dat for how you want your switch to boot up 

A1. Pick the type of boot.dat you want to have use then rename it to boot.dat copy the boot.dat on to the root of your Sd card
 
A2. Copy every thing  thats in the Atmosphere vs Sxos folder on to the root of your Sd card too

A3. Put Sd card in switch 

A4. put your switch into rcm mode 



B. if you want Emunand for sx there are 2 ways 

the Quickest way but will need a pc/laptop/computer


B1.1. tap options then Payloads instead of Emunand and tap hekate_ctcaer_5.5.7.bin
B1.2. tap launch and it will take you to hekate app pick emuMMC
B1.3. tap Create emuMMC
B1.4. tap sd file then it will make a emuMMC 
B1.5. when finished tap closed it should take you back to the hekate menu
B1.6. tap power off and shut down you switch 
B1.7. boot your switch up and tab Atmosphere wait for it to load
B1.8. tap the album and the homebrew menu will load 
B1.9. tap daybreak 
B1.10. tap install 
B1.11. select the directory Firmware 11.0.0 this will update or down date to 11.0.0 ofw
B1.12. tap continue 
B1.13. tap preserve settings 
B1.14. it will the start to install frimware 11.0.0 
B1.15 when finished tap shut down 
B1.16. take your sd card out of you switch and put it in to you pc 
B1.17. on the sdcard you should see a folder called emuMMC there should be a folder called SD00 or SD01 click the one You want 
B1.18. in that folder there will be a folder called eMMC click that
B1.19. in that folder there will be a 10 files 
B1.20. Rename the files like this 

00 to full.00.bin
01 to full.01.bin
02 to full.02.bin
03 to full.03.bin
04 to full.04.bin
05 to full.05.bin
06 to full.06.bin
07 to full.07.bin
BOOT0 to boot0.bin
BOOT1 to boot1.bin

B1.21. rename the folder to emunand 
B1.22. put the emunand folder into the sxos folder which is on the root of the sd card 
B1.23. put sd card in switch and turn on then Pick which cfw you want to use Atmosphere or Sxos 

The other way is just to tap options then emunand but this way takes alot longer and if you switch is on ofw higher then 11.0.0 already ur switch wont boot of emunand when trying to use sxos

u will need to make anther emuMMC for Atmosphere ifu dont wanna use sys nand
very easy to do if stick just repeat B1.1 to B1.6 

Always use daybreak when updating Atmosphere 
 
sxos can ONLY work upto 11.0.0 
Atmosphere can be update to the latest ofw which ath the moment is 12.0.3

I think the best one to pick is emunand No Auto boot.dat so that every time you load up Your switch you can pick which custom firmware 
you want and you get best of both 

if u do pick autoboot to get to the menu you have to press volume up (+) when booting up the switch

alittle tip if your trying to get new games to work on sxos use switch army knife

i am thinking about doing some more themes for sxos
